<p> Financing Policies</p>
<p> We have marketed our product on all social media platforms and have attended conventions to make our product more known. Also, working with sponsors has given us more funding opportunities for our product. To ensure financial stability, we have created a budget of %50,0000 for pre-manufacture and $20,000 for production. This will ensure we have a stable plan moving forward. To go along with this, we plan for the future by paying off our debt and building a strong foundation to keep our business running.</p>
<p> Delivery Policies</p>
<p> We offer many shipping methods such as standard, express, and next-day delivery. Once the order is placed, you will receive a confirmation email regarding when your product will arrive to you.</p>
<p> Return Policies</p>
<p> We offer a 30-60 day return policy, allowing used products to be returned. However, it cannot be returned if the product is tampered with or broken. If you find anything wrong with a product after delivery, we respect giving a complete refund or sending a new product to the customer.</p>
