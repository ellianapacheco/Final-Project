	<p>Clean Current was founded by Chantelle Peters in 2008. We originally sold underwater cameras to observe life under water, but later realized sea life was scared off by the technology. This led us to create a new product, creating a real-life looking robotic fish that observed the underwater life where pollution and waste is most common. From the data used with the robot, we can easily come up with a solution to prevent more waste from collecting here.</p>
	<p>With over a decade of experience in this industry, we have proven to be extremely successful. With out regional locations based near the coast, we are able to gain first-hand data by being so close to the ocean. From the data collected from our product, we can significantly improve ocean pollution and waste, allowing for our oceans to become cleaner. Our employees come from the highest ranked universities from across the world with a passion in making our oceans a better place for sea life.</p>
