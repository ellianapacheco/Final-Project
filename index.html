	<h1>History</h1>
	<p>Clean Current was founded by Chantelle Peters in 2008. We originally sold underwater cameras to observe life underwater, but later realized the technology scared sea life off. This led us to create a new product, a real-life-looking robotic fish that observed underwater life where pollution and waste are most common. From the data used with the robot, we can easily come up with a solution to prevent more waste from collecting here.</p>
	<h1>Why Us?</h1>
	<p>With over a decade of experience in this industry, we have proven extremely successful. Without regional locations based near the coast, we can gain first-hand data by being so close to the ocean. From the data collected from our product, we can significantly reduce ocean pollution and waste, allowing our oceans to become cleaner. Our employees come from the highest-ranked universities from across the world with a passion for making our oceans a better place for sea life.</p>
